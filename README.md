# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a **Deep Learning–based Brain Tumor Detection System** that analyzes MRI images to predict whether a brain tumor is present or not.  
It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on medical image datasets and can be deployed either as a **standalone Python script** or a **Flask web app**.

## 📖 Overview

Brain tumors are one of the most serious medical conditions that require early detection for effective treatment.  
This project aims to assist medical professionals by automatically classifying MRI brain scans as **Tumor** or **No Tumor** using a trained deep learning model.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Automatic MRI classification** — Detects presence of tumor from MRI images.  
- 🧩 **Deep Learning Model (VGG / CNN)** — Trained on medical imaging datasets.  
- 🧪 **Custom model integration** — Uses pre-trained model `model_vgg_full.h5`.  
- 🌐 **Flask web interface** — Upload MRI and get instant prediction.  
- 📊 **Visualization support** — Plots accuracy, loss, and prediction output.
